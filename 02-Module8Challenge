/*
Module 8 Challenge: SQL Statements
*/

/*
Instructions:
For this challenge, we'll be retrieving, sorting, and 
filtering data from the Northwind Database. 
We'll also insert records, update, and delete records.


Use the Northwind database for this assignment. Use the
instructions in the comments to write the SQL statements
for this assignment.
 
Run and test your SQL code using the sqlcmd command in the Terminal.
Here's an example: 
sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P P@ssw0rd -d Northwind -Q "SELECT * FROM Customers;"
*/


USE Northwind;

/*

/*
7. Your boss has asked you for a list of orders for
       the employee Janet Leverling. 
       The list should contain the order ID, the company name
	   of the customer, and the name of the employee who
	   helped place the order.
       (Hint: Use a JOIN to retrieve data from more than one table.)
*/

/*
8. Insert a new record into the products table with a product name
    that is your favorite food, a unit price that is $4.55, supplier ID 26, and category ID 5.
*/
 


/*
9. Display the new record you added to the products table 
where the product name is your favorite food.
*/

/*

    The record should contain the following values:
    - Supplier ID 30
	- Your school's name as the CompanyName

*/

/*
13. Insert a new record into the Categories table.

CategoryName and Description columns. You don't need to insert
a value into the CategoryID column because that it auto-populated.
You don't need to insert a value into the Picture column 
because it is optional.
